- Variable names should start with a lowercase letter!!!!!
+ Great variable names, although I would have called the loop control variable gameLoop and not LoopLoop
+ Great formatting

- I get erroneous behavior when I attempt to cast a spell.  The console stops displaying the prompt text until I provide another combat option.
